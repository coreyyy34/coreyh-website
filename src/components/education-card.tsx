            <p>
              I am currently pursuing a degree in Engineering, specializing in
              Software Engineering, with a strong emphasis on both theoretical
              foundations and hands-on practical experience. Heavily project
              based, involving collaboration in team environments to design,
              develop, and deliver software solutions.

              Relevant Coursework
            </h4>
            <p>
              My coursework spans core areas of software engineering, including
              software design, algorithms, databases, computer networks, and web
              architectures. It also includes human-computer interaction,
              artificial intelligence, and engineering-focused topics such as
              project management, economics, and professional communication.
